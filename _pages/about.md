# üòä About Me

- I am about to become a Specially Appointed Associate Researcher (Áâπ‰ªªÂâØÁ†îÁ©∂Âëò) at [Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center](https://iai.ustc.edu.cn/nsjsys.jhtml) since July, 2025.
- I got my Ph. D. degree from School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/)) in 2025, supervised by Prof. [S. Kevin Zhou](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html).
- I received my bachelor's and master's degree (Supervisor: [Zhongze Gu](https://bme.seu.edu.cn/2011/1017/c463a12264/page.psp)) from Southeast University ([SEU](https://www.seu.edu.cn)) in 2018 and 2021, respectively.
- My research interests mainly focus on **algorithm fairness in medical image analysis**, and **AI technologies in major neurological disorders of the brain**.
